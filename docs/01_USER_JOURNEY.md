## Narrative Arc

### The Old Way (Problem)
"You chat with AI. You copy-paste code. You repeat yourself. You lose context. Your team does it differently. Nothing is reusable. It's better than nothing, but it's not the future."

### The Amplifier Way (Solution)
"You write down what you want once. AI executes it perfectly every time. Your team shares workflows. Context accumulates automatically. Failures resume, not restart. It's composable, observable, and yours."

### The Vision (Transformation)
"Imagine a world where building software is about declaring outcomes, not writing code. Where roles don't matter, only results. Where anyone with an idea can build tools that think. That world is here."
