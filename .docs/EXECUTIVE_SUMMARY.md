# Executive Summary

## The Opportunity

Developers think of AI as "better autocomplete" or "vibe coding." They're missing a fundamental shift: **AI as composable middleware for building intelligent applications**.

Amplifier enables this future, but most people don't understand what's possible. We need to show them through experience, not documentation.

---

## The Solution

A web experience that transforms how people think about AI development through **four simple sections** and **mode-based personalization**.

### The Four-Section Experience

#### 1. One-Pager (The Hook)
**Purpose:** Capture attention and communicate core value in 30 seconds

**Content:**
- Why Amplifier exists (the problem with current AI development)
- What makes it different (composable, modular, declarative)
- Who it's for (4 audience modes)
- Primary CTA: "Try It Now" → Sandbox

**Goal:** Intrigue → Understanding → Action

---

#### 2. Crash Course (The Education)
**Purpose:** Build mental models and understanding

**Content:**
- **Core Concepts:** Bundles, Modules, Agents, Recipes
- **How It Works:** Visual architecture diagrams
- **Interactive Tutorials:** Learn by doing (5-10 min each)
- **Video Walkthrough:** See it in action (3 minutes)
- **Technical Deep-Dive:** For those who want details (links to architecture guide)

**Goal:** Understanding → Confidence

---

#### 3. Sandbox (The Experience)
**Purpose:** Let users experience Amplifier's power hands-on

**Components:**

**Recipe Playground**
- Execute pre-built recipes in browser
- See real-time multi-agent orchestration
- Understand through concrete examples
- No installation required

**Builder Studio**
- Create custom recipes visually
- Compose bundles for your needs
- Fork and remix community creations
- Export for local use

**Gallery**
- Discover community recipes and bundles
- Filter by use case and complexity
- Fork and customize
- Share your creations

**Goal:** Experience → Belief → Adoption

---

#### 4. GitHub (The Resources)
**Purpose:** Provide depth for developers who want to build

**Content:**
- **Repositories:** Core, Foundation, Modules, Bundles
- **Documentation:** Complete API reference and guides
- **Examples:** Working code samples and patterns
- **Community:** Issues, discussions, contributions

**Goal:** Knowledge → Building → Contributing

---

## Mode-Based Personalization

Rather than one-size-fits-all, we serve **four distinct audiences**:

### 🎯 Normie Mode
*For non-technical users*
- Simplified interfaces
- Pre-configured recipes
- High-level outcomes
- **Value:** Get things done without coding

### 🔍 Explorer Mode
*For technical non-developers*
- Analysis and inspection tools
- Read-only operations emphasized
- Structured workflows
- **Value:** Investigate and understand systems

### 💻 Developer Mode
*For software developers*
- Full development toolkit
- Code-focused workflows
- Reversible operations
- **Value:** AI-powered development assistance

### 🚀 Expert Mode
*For power users and architects*
- Full platform access
- Custom bundle/module creation
- Advanced orchestration
- **Value:** Build on top of Amplifier

**Key Insight:** Users self-select their mode based on goals, not forced progression.

## Why This Approach Works

### 1. Progressive Disclosure
Start simple, reveal complexity as needed. Users aren't overwhelmed but can access depth when ready.

### 2. Show, Don't Tell
Sandbox lets users experience Amplifier's power directly. Better than any documentation.

### 3. Multiple Entry Points
Four sections serve different needs:
- Need quick overview? → One-pager
- Want to learn? → Crash course
- Ready to try? → Sandbox
- Building something? → GitHub

### 4. Mode-Based Experience
Right experience for right audience. No more "this is too complex" or "this is too simple."

### 5. Community-Driven Growth
Gallery and sharing turn users into contributors. Network effects amplify reach.

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- Build one-pager
- Create basic sandbox with 5 showcase recipes
- Implement mode selection
- Deploy MVP

**Goal:** Validate core experience

### Phase 2: Depth (Weeks 5-8)
- Add crash course content
- Expand sandbox capabilities
- Enable recipe creation
- Add basic gallery

**Goal:** Enable learning and creation

### Phase 3: Community (Weeks 9-12)
- Full gallery with search and filters
- Sharing and forking
- Community features
- Polish and optimization

**Goal:** Foster ecosystem growth

### Post-Launch: Iteration
- Add advanced builders
- Expand recipe catalog
- Enhance mode experiences
- Build integrations

---

## Resource Requirements

### Core Team (Months 1-6)
- 1 PM (strategy, coordination, stakeholder management)
- 2-3 Engineers (1-2 frontend, 1 backend/full-stack)
- 0.5 Designer (UI/UX, visual design)
- 0.5 Content Creator (docs, tutorials, videos)

**Total: ~4-5 FTEs for 6 months**

### Budget (Year 1)
- **Development (6 months):** ~$250K (team)
- **Infrastructure:** ~$15K/year (hosting, services)
- **Launch:** ~$25K (marketing, content)
- **Post-launch:** ~$10K/month (infrastructure + community)

**Total Year 1: ~$400K**

## Key Differentiators

### Compared to Documentation
Documentation tells. This **shows** through interactive experience.

### Compared to Chat Interfaces
Chat is ephemeral. Amplifier is **declarative and reusable**.

### Compared to No-Code Platforms
No-code is limited. Amplifier is **fully extensible** while staying accessible.

### Compared to AI Frameworks
Frameworks are for experts only. Amplifier serves **everyone** through modes.

---

## The Vision

**Today:** Developers chat with AI, copy-paste code, repeat themselves.

**Tomorrow:** Anyone declares what they want, AI orchestrates the work, results are reproducible and shareable.

**Amplifier is the bridge.**

This web experience is how we bring people across.

---

## What Makes This Different

### Not Just Another Demo Site
This is a **transformation platform**. Users don't just see what Amplifier does - they experience paradigm shift firsthand.

### Not Just Documentation
Documentation explains. This **converts** through experience.

### Not Just for Developers
Four modes mean four audiences, expanding reach far beyond typical developer tools.

### Not Just Showcase
Sandbox lets users create real value immediately, even without installing anything.

## Next Steps

1. **Review & Align** - Get stakeholder buy-in on this approach
2. **Assemble Team** - Identify or hire necessary resources
3. **Design & Prototype** - Create mockups for key flows
4. **Build Phase 1** - Deliver MVP in 4 weeks
5. **Test & Iterate** - Validate with real users
6. **Scale** - Expand based on feedback and metrics

---

## Open Questions for Discussion

1. **Scope:** Should we launch with all 4 modes or start with 2-3?
2. **Hosting:** GitHub Pages static + API backend, or fully hosted?
3. **Community:** Build community features early or wait for adoption?
4. **Content:** Create all recipes in-house or curate community contributions?
5. **Monetization:** Free forever, or plan for paid tiers?

---

## Why This Matters

Amplifier represents a fundamental shift in how we build with AI. But paradigm shifts don't spread through documentation - they spread through **experience**.

When someone uses the sandbox and sees three AI agents orchestrate a complex code review in 90 seconds, they don't just learn what Amplifier does - **they see the future**.

That's what this web experience delivers: not information, but transformation.
