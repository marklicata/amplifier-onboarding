5. Next steps (30 sec)

**Example Script: "Build Your First Recipe"**
```
[0:00] "Have you ever wished you could automate your entire 
       code review process? Not just get suggestions, but 
       actually orchestrate multiple specialized AI agents 
       to analyze, critique, and improve your code?"

[0:30] "By the end of this video, you'll have a working 
       recipe that does exactly that. And it'll take us 
       just 10 minutes."

[1:00] "Let's start by opening the Recipe Builder..."

[10:00] "And there you have it! You just automated what 
        would take hours of manual review. Now go build 
        something amazing."
```

### 2. Blog Posts

**Structure:**
- Compelling headline (curiosity + value)
- Hook (relatable problem or bold claim)
- Context (why this matters now)

- CTA (next step for reader)

**Example: "Why Declarative Workflows Beat Chat-Based Coding"**
```markdown
# Why Declarative Workflows Beat Chat-Based Coding

## The Problem with AI Chat

You've been there: You're in a flow with your AI assistant. 
You've explained your problem, gotten some good suggestions, 
and you're iterating. Then your session times out. Or you 
need to do the same thing tomorrow. Or your teammate asks 
how you did it.

And you're starting from scratch.

## What If You Could Write It Once?

Imagine writing down your workflow once:
1. Analyze architecture
2. Find bugs
3. Check security
4. Generate report

Then running it anytime. On any code. Sharing it with your 
team. Building on each other's work.

That's what declarative workflows enable...

### 3. Social Media Content

**Twitter/X Strategy:**

**Thread Format:**
```
1/7 🧵 Most developers think AI = fancy autocomplete.

They're missing the bigger picture.

Here's how to think about AI as composable middleware 
instead: 👇

2/7 Traditional approach:
You → AI Chat → Copy/Paste → Repeat

Problems:
• No memory across sessions
• Can't share with team
• Not repeatable
• Context lost

3/7 The Amplifier approach:
You → Write Recipe → AI Orchestration → Results

Benefits:
• One-time setup
• Team sharing
• Perfect repeatability
• Context preserved
