## Appendix B: Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Practicing Without Purpose**
   - Don't just play ranked games and hope to improve
   - Always have a specific focus for each session
   - Track whether you're actually practicing what you intend to

2. **Ignoring Mental Game**
   - Tilt and burnout kill more improvement than lack of skill
   - Take breaks, manage emotions, maintain perspective
   - Gaming should be challenging but enjoyable

3. **Comparing to Others**
   - Everyone improves at different rates
   - Focus on your own progress, not others' ranks
   - Use pros as learning resources, not sources of inadequacy

4. **Neglecting Physical Health**
   - Poor posture, lack of exercise, bad sleep = worse performance
   - Take care of your body to take care of your game
   - Wrist/hand health is critical for longevity

5. **Overtraining**
   - More practice ≠ better results if you're fatigued
   - Quality > quantity always
   - Rest days are part of the improvement process

6. **Not Reviewing VODs**
   - You can't see your mistakes in the moment
   - VOD review is where real learning happens
   - Even 20 minutes per week makes a huge difference

7. **Giving Up Too Soon**
   - Improvement is not linear
   - Plateaus are normal and temporary
   - 30 days is just the beginning of the journey
