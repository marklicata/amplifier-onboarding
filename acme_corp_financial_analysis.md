- DIO = (Average Inventory / COGS) × 365 = ($6,250 / $32,000) × 365 = **71.3 days**

**Days Sales Outstanding (DSO):**
- Average Accounts Receivable: ($8,000 + $7,200) / 2 = $7,600
- DSO = (Average A/R / Revenue) × 365 = ($7,600 / $50,000) × 365 = **55.5 days**

**Days Payables Outstanding (DPO):**
- Average Accounts Payable: ($4,000 + $3,600) / 2 = $3,800
