# Amplifier Onboarding

## Vision

Transform how developers think about AI application development by showing them a future where **roles dissolve** and **outcomes matter**. Not TPMs, not developers—just people using powerful tools to achieve their goals.

## The Challenge

**Current Mental Models:**
- "Vibe coding" - Chat with AI, get some code
- AI as a smart autocomplete or copilot
- Linear developer workflows

**The Amplifier Paradigm:**
- AI as middleware for building next-gen applications
- Composable, modular architecture enabling new experiences
- Declarative workflows that anyone can understand and customize
- Tools that empower outcomes, not just coding

## The Opportunity

Create an interactive web experience that:
1. **Shows** what's possible through pre-configured recipes
2. **Teaches** by letting users build their own modules, bundles, and recipes
3. **Converts** curiosity into adoption by lowering the barrier to entry

## Project Structure

This directory contains:

- **01_USER_JOURNEY.md** - Personas, stages, and transformation path
- **02_WEB_EXPERIENCE_DESIGN.md** - Architecture and UX for the showcase site
- **03_RECIPE_CATALOG.md** - Pre-built recipes that demonstrate value
- **04_BUILDER_EXPERIENCE.md** - Tools for customization and learning
- **05_CONTENT_STRATEGY.md** - Educational content and messaging
- **06_TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Implementation details and stack
- **07_ROADMAP.md** - Phased delivery plan with milestones

## Core Principles

1. **Show, Don't Tell** - Live demos beat documentation
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Start simple, reveal complexity gradually
3. **Immediate Value** - Users should see results in minutes, not hours
4. **Learning by Doing** - Interactive tutorials over passive reading
5. **Community-Driven** - Enable sharing and remixing
