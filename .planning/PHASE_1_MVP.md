# Phase 1: Minimal Viable Product

**Timeline:** Weeks 3-4
**Goal:** Users can run pre-built recipes and see results

## Week 3: Gallery + Execution

### Gallery
- [ ] Gallery API endpoint (`/api/gallery`)
- [ ] Gallery UI (card grid)
- [ ] Filter by type (recipe/bundle)
- [ ] Recipe detail view (modal or page)
- [ ] "Run" button UI

### Execution Engine
- [ ] Execute prompt API (`/api/execute`)
- [ ] WebSocket streaming (`/ws/stream/{id}`)
- [ ] Recipe executor in session pool
- [ ] Real-time execution viewer UI
- [ ] Error handling and display

### Pre-Built Content
Create 5 showcase recipes:
- [ ] 1. Code Review
- [ ] 2. Documentation Generator
- [ ] 3. Test Coverage Analysis
- [ ] 4. Security Audit
- [ ] 5. Codebase Overview

**Milestone:** ✅ User can run a recipe and see results stream in real-time

## Week 4: Polish + Beta Testing

### Polish
- [ ] Loading states everywhere
- [ ] Empty states (no results, etc.)
- [ ] Error messages (user-friendly)
- [ ] Mobile responsive (basic)
- [ ] Rate limit UI (show remaining)

### Content
- [ ] Homepage (1-pager)
  - [ ] Hero section with value props
  - [ ] Mode selector
  - [ ] CTA to Playground
- [ ] About Amplifier (simple page)
- [ ] GitHub links

### Testing
- [ ] Invite 10 internal beta testers
- [ ] Set up feedback mechanism
- [ ] Monitor analytics dashboard
- [ ] Fix critical bugs

**Milestone:** ✅ Usable MVP with real users testing

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] 50+ beta testers signed up
- [ ] 100+ recipe executions
- [ ] No critical bugs
- [ ] Positive feedback from testers
- [ ] Average execution time < 5 seconds

## Notes

- This is the moment of truth - does it work?
- Focus on core experience, not bells and whistles
- Get real user feedback early
